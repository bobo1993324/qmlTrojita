/** @short An embeddable QWebView with some safety checks and modified resizing

  This class configures the QWebView in such a way that it will prevent certain
  dangerous (or unexpected, in the context of a MUA) features from being invoked.

  Another function is to configure the QWebView in such a way that it resizes
  itself to show all required contents.

  Note that you still have to provide a proper eventFilter in the parent widget
  (and register it for use).
